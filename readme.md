A quick script to set zoom locations in illustrator. Basically budget Walmart Manim for when you don't have the time or skill to actually animate things, so you just go around ind zoom. Originally, the actual zooming was going to be included too, but we couldn't find a way to do a continuous zoom pragmatically. Team: FlynNick, owen2925, Exr0n.
